# Advent of Code
A collection of all my personal efforts at Advent of Code.

# Compiling & Running
## C#
Compile the relevant solution and run it. For 2018, running specific solutions
requires editing Program.cs. For later ones, there's a terminal-based selection
screen.

## Rust
Compile with `cargo build`.

For now, just pass a number in as a command line argument. It'll run the
solutions for the corresponding day (or `cargo run x`).
